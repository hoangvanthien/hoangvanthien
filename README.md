Welcome to my GitHub page. I'm currently a final-year undergrad, majoring in Software Engineering.

Nevertheless, I have a huge knack for Mathematics. I hope I'd dive into a research career later in life. ğŸ™ˆ

Since you're here, I'd kindly ask you to visit [my blog](https://www.tvhoang.com) where you could read more about what I did.

Have a good day ğŸ¤Ÿ
